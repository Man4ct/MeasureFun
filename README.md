# MeasureFun

## Overview

MeasureFun is an iOS app developed using SwiftUI, ARKit, RealityKit, and Combine. The app's primary purpose is to serve as a learning project, providing a hands-on experience with cutting-edge technologies in augmented reality and 3D design. Through the creation of this app, i am aiming to deepen my understanding of SwiftUI for user interface development, ARKit for augmented reality features, RealityKit for 3D content rendering, and Combine for handling asynchronous events.

## Features

- **ARKit Integration:** Utilizes the power of ARKit to enable augmented reality experiences within the app.
  
- **RealityKit Implementation:** Leverages RealityKit for seamless integration and rendering of 3D content, bringing the delightful snowman to life in the user's physical space.

- **SwiftUI UI:** The app's user interface is built with SwiftUI, offering a modern and declarative approach to creating engaging and interactive designs.

- **Combine Framework:** Harnesses the Combine framework for handling asynchronous and event-driven code, enhancing the overall responsiveness and efficiency of the app.

- **Voice-Over Accessibility:** Implements VoiceOver support, making the app accessible for blind users. This feature ensures that everyone, regardless of their visual abilities, can enjoy and benefit from MeasureFun.

## Getting Started

To run MeasureFun on your local machine, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Man4ct/MeasureFun.git

## Purpose

The primary goal of MeasureFun is to provide a practical playground for learning and experimenting with the latest technologies in the field of augmented reality, VoiceOver Accessibility and 3D design.

## Future Development

While MeasureFun currently focuses on measuring distances between 3D snowmen, the project remains open to expansion. Future development may include additional AR features, more 3D assets, and enhancements to the user interface. The developer welcomes contributions and suggestions from the open-source community to further enrich the app.

## Accessibility

MeasureFun supports VoiceOver accessibility, ensuring an inclusive experience for users with visual impairments.
